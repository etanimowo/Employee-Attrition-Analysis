- **Satisfaction Levels vs. Last Evaluation Scores**
- **Workload Trends**: Monthly hours and number of projects.
- **Top Reasons for Employee Departures**

# *3. Tools Used*
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables and Charts**: To create interactive insights.

# *Key Insights*
- A strong correlation exists between low satisfaction levels and high attrition rates.
- Departments with predominantly low salaries showed significantly higher turnover.
- Excessive workloads (higher monthly hours and projects) contribute to employee departures.
- Lack of promotions over time correlates with higher attrition.

# *Conclusion*
This project highlights the power of HR analytics in identifying trends and addressing key areas to improve employee retention. By analyzing and visualizing workforce data, organizations can implement targeted strategies to reduce turnover and foster a positive work environment.
